### Current Main Objective of Project
Build a competent team of lua programmers who specialize in love 2D game development.


### Current Side Objective of Project
**Info**   
  Most or all of us have worked in some other game engines before.   
  We can still recall how easy it was to perform certain functions like   
  * **moving a character from the screen**
  * **performing animations and adjusting the speeds**   
  
  We seek to achieve this level of ease by implementing functions and other useful   
  concepts learnt, which help us achieve the same or almost equal level of productivity   
  **NB:** We do not sacrifice our proficiency in core language features of LOVE for    
          easiness.

**Summary**
  Build any component(in form of function, table, etc) which would be useful   
  when carrying out any big project
